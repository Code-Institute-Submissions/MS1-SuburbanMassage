- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme
    - ##### A blend of natural earthy 'nurturing' colouring in conjunction with other nature orientated colours of purple/lilac blends to set a peaceful and tranquil scene for the user. 

  - #### Typography
    - ##### A bold but soft 'comforting feel' font was used to provide the user with a gentle experience in line with the overall purpose of the site in provding a relaxing and calming service. 

  - #### Imagery
    - ##### To coincide with the colour scheme and overall 'feel' of the site a relaxing beach sunrise image with purple/lilac tones in the background is used, for that grounding and relaxation feel. A short video take of a massage to also help ensure there is no doubiety of the purpose of the site.

- ### UX Design Planes
    - #### Stategy
        - ##### My aim of the design is to make this a simple, stress free, ease of use website for individuals wishing to book for a massage treament.

    - #### Scope
        - ##### For potential clients I want to provide them with a brief synopsis of my who I am, my background, qualifications and experience. Providing an option for contact also should they wish to ask more about the treatments on offer.

    - #### Structure 
        - ##### I want the site to be intuitive, consistent and easy to navigate. I aim to use seperate 'cards' to highlight the benefits of massage, the treatments on offer and details about me all in any easy to see layout. I aim to keep it minimilistic so that it's easy on the eye and not weighed down with too much detail and loose a potential clients interest.

    - #### Skeleton 
        - ##### Wireframes - [View](https://....) Note basic drawings have been produced rather than on the Balsamiq website due to time constraints, this will be added should time allow. 

        - ##### Mobile Wireframe - [View](https://...) 

    - #### Surface
        - ##### The colour scheme together with the imagery described was used to create an overall pleasant, relaxing, easy on the eye experience.
